:func:`mne.datasets.sample.data_path`

:ref:`ch_sample_data` is recorded using a 306-channel Neuromag vectorview system.

In this experiment, checkerboard patterns were presented to the subject
into the left and right visual field, interspersed by tones to the
left or right ear. The interval between the stimuli was 750 ms. Occasionally
a smiley face was presented at the center of the visual field.
The subject was asked to press a key with the right index finger
as soon as possible after the appearance of the face.

Once the ``data_path`` is known, its contents can be examined using :ref:`IO functions <ch_convert>`.
