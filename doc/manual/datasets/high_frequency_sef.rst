==================
:func:`mne.datasets.hf_sef.data_path()`

This dataset contains somatosensory evoked fields (median nerve stimulation)
with thousands of epochs. It was recorded with an Elekta TRIUX MEG device at
a sampling frequency of 3 kHz. The dataset is suitable for investigating
high-frequency somatosensory responses. Data from two subjects are included
with MRI images in DICOM format and FreeSurfer reconstructions.
